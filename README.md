This is a simple registration form for my project, "How Do You Like Your Salmon?" I build this code **using React** with NodeJS. 
## Getting Started 
  - You will first have to make sure you have my other repository installed. Repository and instructions are here: 
https://github.com/AliBee87/MSSE661MongoAPI
  - Then you will have to enter `npm run dev` to get the server going. 

## To Run Reactive-Salmon

 In your terminal, input  
 ```
  npx create-react-app salmonreact
 ```
 
 
 You'll need to make sure you have the following packages installed: 
 
   ```
    @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core
   
    @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons
    
    @fortawesome/react-fontawesome
    
    axios
   ```
  
  To install, enter `npm i` and the package in your terminal.
   
  Then, to run, go to the file location, then enter `npm start` in your terminal. Thanks for checking my page out!
